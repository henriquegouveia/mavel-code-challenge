# Marvel Code Challenge

## I've not finished the challenge yet because of personal subjects and I'm REALLY sorry about that. It bother me =/
## And how I'm not sure about my deadline I decided to release it to you as it is, but I'm gonna finish it at this weekend (unfinisehd things annoy me) and if you want to check this out on Monday I swear that It'll finished. 

## Explanation
  - I was concerned to make over engineering, but thinking in a real scenario where this app could grow more and more I developed it in a good abstraction level (specially the networkig layer).
  - Another pattern that I questioned myself was the Mediator to abstract as much as possible the flow, taking the resposability off from 'prepareForSegue' in the viewcontrollers. And it can be changed easily by the Coordinator pattern.
  - The view layer is encharge to retain outlets and do the animations with the components.

## What's missing?
  - Filter characters by name, but only screen the rest (service layer, parser and etc) is developed
  - Give more attention to unit test
  - LauchScreen collest animation
  - ReactKit in the search field
  - A cool animation for the search button and search field
